# Change Log

# Compatibility

Versions of Salat prior to this one used earlier versions of Casbah. As mentioned in the official Casbah documentation (http://mongodb.github.io/casbah/3.1/upgrade/), various deprecated methods were removed in the 3.0.0 release. If you attempt to use Salat 1.11+ with an older version of Casbah, you will likely encounter `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` when errors occur and at other inopportune moments.
